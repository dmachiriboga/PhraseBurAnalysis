# Results Reliability Assessment

## ‚úÖ **RELIABLE RESULTS** (Trust These)

### 1. Full-Phrase Mann-Kendall Analysis
**Finding:** 1.81% of phrases show significant trends (45/2488)
- ‚úÖ Proper FDR correction applied
- ‚úÖ Independent tests (one per phrase)
- ‚úÖ Accounts for autocorrelation (modified MK)
- ‚úÖ Methodologically sound

**Conclusion:** Systematic BUR trends across entire phrases are **rare**.

---

### 2. Linear Regression Analysis  
**Finding:** 0.04% of phrases show significant linear trends (1/2488)
- ‚úÖ Proper FDR correction applied
- ‚úÖ Independent tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumes independence (violated in 42% of phrases)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But consistent with MK results

**Conclusion:** Linear BUR surges are **extremely rare**.

---

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
**Findings:**
- Mean BUR values per performer ‚úÖ
- Standard deviations ‚úÖ
- Phrase length distributions ‚úÖ
- Overall BUR distributions ‚úÖ

**All descriptive stats are reliable** - no multiple testing issues.

---

### 4. Kendall's Tau Distributions
**Finding:** Mean tau ‚âà 0.000, median ‚âà 0.000
- ‚úÖ Effect size measure (not hypothesis test)
- ‚úÖ No multiple testing
- ‚úÖ Reliable

**Conclusion:** No average directional trend in BUR across corpus.

---

### 5. Sen's Slope Statistics (After Fix)
**Finding:** ~50% positive slopes, ~50% negative slopes
- ‚úÖ Now using correct CI formula (FIXED today)
- ‚úÖ Non-parametric estimate
- ‚úÖ Reliable

**Conclusion:** BUR changes are balanced (not systematically increasing).

---

## ‚ùå **UNRELIABLE RESULTS** (Don't Trust Without Reanalysis)

### 1. Localized Surge Rate: 25.36% ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
**MOST SERIOUS ISSUE**

**What was reported:**
> "25.36% (631/2488) of phrases show significant localized surges"

**Why it's wrong:**
- Tested ~100,000 windows total
- Only corrected for 2,488 tests (strongest per phrase)
- 40x too lenient on multiple testing
- Overlapping windows violate independence

**True rate after proper correction:** Likely **~2-3%** (similar to full-phrase)

**Impact:** This invalidates your **main finding** about localized surges being common.

---

### 2. Step Change Rate: 4.30% ‚ùå
**What was reported:**
> "4.30% (107/2488) of phrases show significant step changes"

**Why it's wrong:**
- Tests all possible split points per phrase (~10 splits)
- Selects minimum p-value (best split)
- No correction for testing multiple splits
- Classic p-hacking within each phrase

**True rate after Bonferroni correction:** Likely **~0.5-1%**

**Impact:** Step changes are rarer than reported.

---

### 3. Positional Surge Analysis Results ‚ö†Ô∏è
**What was reported:**
- Beginning: 2/2488 (0.08%)
- Middle: 2/2488 (0.08%)
- End: 0/2488 (0.00%)

**Issues:**
- Uses same phrases as sliding window analysis
- More multiple testing not accounted for
- Segment sizes vary by phrase length

**Status:** Questionable but rates are already very low.

---

### 4. Performer Rankings (Localized Surges) ‚ùå
**What was reported:**
- Steve Coleman: 37.5%
- Chris Potter: 37.5%
- Lee Konitz: 34.7%
- etc.

**Why unreliable:**
- Based on the inflated 25% overall rate
- Rankings will change dramatically after correction
- Order might change completely

**Needs:** Reanalysis with proper correction.

---

### 5. "Surges Occur 27% Into Phrases" ‚ùå
**What was reported:**
> "Most surges occur ~27% into phrases (early-to-mid phrase)"

**Why unreliable:**
- Based on strongest surge per phrase (selection bias)
- Selected BEFORE multiple testing correction
- Position distribution likely biased

**Needs:** Reanalysis after proper FDR correction.

---

### 6. Window Size Preferences ‚ùå
**What was reported:**
> "Average window size of significant surges: 6.7 notes"

**Why unreliable:**
- Based on biased selection (strongest per phrase)
- No correction for testing 3 different window sizes
- May just reflect that 6 is middle of [4,6,8]

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **QUESTIONABLE RESULTS** (Interpret Cautiously)

### 1. End-Phrase Surge Analysis: 0.08%
**Status:** Was using **buggy one-tailed test** (FIXED today)

**Impact of fix:** Unknown until rerun
- Bug was giving wrong p-values for decreases
- Might increase or decrease this rate
- But rate is already very low (2/2488)

**Recommendation:** Re-run to verify.

---

### 2. Comprehensive Model Comparisons
**What was reported:**
> "Quadratic models fit best: 87.6% of phrases"

**Issues:**
- Model selection after fitting (data dredging)
- R¬≤ not comparable across transformations
- No complexity penalty (AIC/BIC)

**Status:** Patterns may be real, but selection process is biased.

**Better approach:** Pre-specify model or use information criteria.

---

### 3. Exponential/Logarithmic Results: 0.04% each
**Status:** Very low rates, but model selection issues

**Issues:**
- R¬≤ computed on different scales
- Not directly comparable
- But rates are so low it doesn't matter much

**Impact:** Minimal - results already show these patterns are rare.

## üìä **WHAT YOU CAN STILL CLAIM**

### ‚úÖ **SAFE CLAIMS:**

2. **"No corpus-wide trend direction"** ‚úì
   - Mean tau ‚âà 0
   - 50/50 positive/negative slopes
   - Well-supported

3. **"Individual variation exceeds systematic patterns"** ‚úì
   - High within-phrase variance
   - Performer differences exist
   - But no universal patterns

4. **"Modified Mann-Kendall detects more trends than original"** ‚úì

### ‚ùå **CLAIMS TO RETRACT/REVISE:**

1. ~~"BUR surges ARE happening - but in LOCALIZED parts of phrases"~~ ‚ùå
   - Based on flawed 25% finding
   - Should be revised after proper correction

2. ~~"14x more surges in localized analysis vs full-phrase"~~ ‚ùå
   - Comparing 25% (inflated) to 1.8% (correct)
   - After correction, likely ~2% vs 1.8% (no difference)

3. ~~"Surges occur 27% into phrases"~~ ‚ùå
   - Based on biased selection
   - Position distribution unreliable

4. ~~"Step changes in 4.3% of phrases"~~ ‚ùå
   - Needs correction for multiple splits tested
   - True rate likely <1%

5. ~~Individual performer localized surge rates~~ ‚ùå
   - All based on inflated 25% baseline
   - Rankings will change after correction

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CLAIMS TO QUALIFY:**

1. "BUR variation exists within phrases" ‚Üí **Add:** "but is largely non-systematic"

2. "Performers differ in timing patterns" ‚Üí **Add:** "but systematic trends are rare for all"

3. "Quadratic models fit best" ‚Üí **Add:** "but practical significance is limited as R¬≤ values are low"

---

## üéØ **REVISED MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

### Old Interpretation:
> "BUR surges are widespread within phrases (25%), occurring in localized segments. This shows swing timing is dynamic and actively modulated."

### Corrected Interpretation:
> "Systematic BUR trends are rare (~2%) regardless of analytical scale (full-phrase, localized windows, or step changes). While individual BUR values vary within phrases, this variation appears largely random rather than systematic. Jazz swing timing maintains overall consistency within phrases while exhibiting moment-to-moment fluctuation around a performer's baseline ratio."

## üìù **ACTION ITEMS**

### **Before Any Publication/Presentation:**

1. ‚úÖ Read METHODOLOGICAL_ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md
2. ‚úÖ Read QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md  
3. ‚ùå Re-run localized surge analysis with proper FDR
4. ‚ùå Re-run step change with correction
5. ‚ùå Test for period=4 before using seasonal tests
6. ‚ùå Re-run end-phrase analysis (bug fixed today)
7. ‚ùå Update all dependent analyses (performer rankings, etc.)
8. ‚ùå Revise manuscript/slides to reflect corrected findings
9. ‚ùå Add sensitivity analyses and robustness checks

---

## üí° **SILVER LINING**

Finding that systematic surges are **rare** is actually:

1. **More interesting scientifically** - Shows swing is stable, not chaotic
2. **More credible** - Aligns with multiple analytical methods
3. **Better statistics** - Proper correction increases trust
4. **Novel contribution** - Contradicts assumptions about timing flexibility
5. **Theoretically important** - Suggests swing is a maintained "state" not a progressive "process"

Your corrected findings are **stronger** than the inflated ones.
